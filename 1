WITH Event3Times AS (
    SELECT CustomerID, ProductID, MIN(Date) as FirstEvent3Time
    FROM Events
    WHERE EventID = 3
    GROUP BY CustomerID, ProductID
)

SELECT e.CustomerID, e.ProductID, COUNT(e2.EventID) AS Event2BeforeEvent3
FROM Event3Times e
LEFT JOIN Events e2 ON e.CustomerID = e2.CustomerID AND e.ProductID = e2.ProductID AND e2.EventID = 2 AND e2.Date < e.FirstEvent3Time
GROUP BY e.CustomerID, e.ProductID;
